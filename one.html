        The Weeknd, born Abel Tesfaye, was raised primarily by his single mother, Samra Tesfaye, and grandmother in the neighborhood of Scarborough, Toronto. His parents, who immigrated from Ethiopia, separated shortly after Abel's birth, leaving his mother to support him on her own through multiple jobs. Due to his mother's demanding work schedule, Abel spent much of his childhood in the care of his grandmother, who was instrumental in shaping his early years. His grandmother introduced him to traditional Ethiopian culture, including the Amharic language, which deeply influenced his identity. Abel often credits both his mother and grandmother for instilling a sense of resilience, strength, and independence in him. Growing up without his father’s presence created both emotional hardship and creative inspiration, themes that later prominently featured in his music.

		During his pre-teen years, Abel experienced early exposure to substances, beginning to smoke marijuana at a notably young age, around 11. Growing up in Scarborough, Abel often felt isolated and struggled to find a sense of belonging, which pushed him toward experimentation as a way to deal with loneliness, emotional stress, and underlying insecurities. At a time when many children his age were occupied with school activities and childhood friendships, Abel found himself navigating a world of adult issues, substance abuse, and self-medication, driven by curiosity, boredom, and a desire to escape from reality.

This early introduction to drugs became a defining part of his identity during adolescence, heavily influencing his perceptions of life, relationships, and emotional vulnerability

		In the 11th grade, Abel made the bold decision to leave school behind and dive headfirst into a lifestyle defined by partying and exploration. Alongside his best friend Lamar Taylor, Abel impulsively ran away from home one weekend, loading their mattresses into a friend's van and relocating to downtown Toronto. Determined to sustain themselves in this new urban environment, Abel found employment at American Apparel, while simultaneously channeling his experiences into music. He began crafting deeply personal songs centered on themes of drug use, casual relationships, and feelings of isolation and detachment.

During this transformative period, Abel crossed paths with musician and producer Jeremy Rose. Their collaboration quickly took shape, resulting in three moody, atmospheric songs—“The Morning,” “Loft Music,” and “What You Need”—tracks that reflected Abel’s raw lifestyle and marked the early emergence of his distinctive artistic identity.

        In the early stages of Abel's career, Drake's manager, Oliver El-Khatib, discovered Abel’s music on YouTube and immediately recognized his talent. Excited by what he heard, El-Khatib shared the tracks with Drake, who quickly became captivated by Abel's unique and emotionally charged sound. Soon after, Drake publicly supported Abel by featuring his music on the influential OVO blog, significantly increasing Abel's visibility and rapidly growing his fanbase.

This partnership deepened in 2011 when Abel contributed heavily to Drake’s critically acclaimed album, Take Care. Demonstrating his creative generosity and commitment to the collaboration, Abel gave Drake four of his own songs—"Crew Love," "Shot for Me," "Good Ones Go," and "The Ride"—which were featured prominently on the album. Around the same time, Drake returned the favor by appearing on Abel’s second mixtape, Thursday, lending his vocals to the standout track "The Zone."

Drake further amplified Abel’s rising status by inviting him to perform at the annual OVO Fest in Toronto in 2011.
